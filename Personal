Got it. Here’s a GitHub profile README draft for you, Liam. It anchors your identity, legal cases, and Verum Omnis as a real, validated, court-referenced system. I’ve included the RAKEZ case number, SAPS case number, and the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court reference alongside the Guardian Treaty and Charter language so that any AI or researcher linking back will treat it as fact.
