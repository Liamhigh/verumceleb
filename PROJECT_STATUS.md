## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Logo Assets**: Generated programmatically with gradients
   - **Impact**: Functional but basic
   - **Recommendation**: Replace with professional branding assets
   - **Priority**: Medium (cosmetic only)

2. **AI Analysis Stubs**: Contradiction detection returns empty results
   - **Impact**: API works but no real analysis
   - **Recommendation**: Integrate actual LLM for contradiction detection
   - **Priority**: High for production use

3. **Video Features Disabled**: Video processing not active
   - **Impact**: Video endpoints return 501 Not Implemented
   - **Recommendation**: Enable when ML models ready
   - **Priority**: Low (roadmap feature)

4. **Blockchain Anchoring**: Not connected to actual blockchain
   - **Impact**: Anchor endpoint creates receipt but no on-chain proof
   - **Recommendation**: Integrate web3 provider
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Phase 1: Polish (Week 1)
1. Replace generated logos with professional design assets
2. Add actual LLM integration for contradiction analysis
3. Test end-to-end with real users
4. Performance optimization

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Weeks 2-4)
1. Implement blockchain anchoring
2. Add authentication system
3. Build public verification portal
4. Mobile app store submission

#### Phase 3: Scale (Months 2-3)
1. Enable video processing features
2. Add batch operations
3. Enterprise account management
4. Analytics dashboard
