## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Before First Deploy

- [ ] Configure Firebase project
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Review and update Firestore rules (if needed)
- [ ] Test local builds (`cd verum-web && npm run build`)
- [ ] Test Firebase Functions (`cd functions && npm test`)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to main branch** - Triggers automatic deployment
2. **Monitor Actions** - Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
3. **Review smoke tests** - Verify all endpoints are accessible
4. **Test production URL** - Manual verification of deployed site

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify site is live at Firebase Hosting URL
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify Firestore rules (if configured)
- [ ] Monitor for errors in Firebase Console
- [ ] Update DNS (if using custom domain)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Firestore Test Timeouts
**Issue:** Two tests timeout during Firestore initialization  
**Impact:** Non-blocking, tests pass in real deployment  
**Workaround:** Tests use `SKIP_IMMUTABLE_VERIFY=1` flag  
**Status:** Will be addressed in future release

### Missing Secrets Graceful Handling
**Behavior:** Workflows continue with warnings when secrets are missing  
**Impact:** Deployment steps are skipped but other tasks complete  
**Status:** By design for flexibility
