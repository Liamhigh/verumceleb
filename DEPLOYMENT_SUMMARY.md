## 📋 What Was Built

### Client-Only AI Assistant
A **chat-first web application** that runs 100% in the browser with zero server dependencies for core features.

**Core Capabilities:**
- 💬 Natural chat interface (empathetic, context-aware)
- 🔐 SHA-512 hashing (instant, Web Crypto API)
- 📄 OCR extraction (PDFs via pdf.js, images via tesseract.js)
- ✅ Triple-consensus verification (3 independent checkers)
- 🔒 PDF sealing (watermark, QR codes, certification)
- ⚓ Anchor receipts (timestamped proof records)
- 🎬 Video integration (Firebase Storage, no binaries in repo)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Libraries (CDN):**
  - pdf-lib 1.17.1 (PDF generation)
  - qrcode 1.5.3 (QR code creation)
  - pdf.js 4.6.82 (PDF text extraction)
  - tesseract.js 5.x (OCR for images)
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (static)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (automated deployment)

### Privacy & Security
- ✅ Stateless (no server-side storage)
- ✅ Client-side hashing only
- ✅ Works 100% offline after page load
