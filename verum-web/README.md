# Verum Omnis Web Application

A Next.js-based web interface for the Verum Omnis constitutional AI guardian. This application implements the listener-first conversation behavior spec for document analysis, fraud detection, and forensic sealing.

## Features

### üéØ Listener-First AI Chat
- Context-aware document analysis
- Empathetic conversation flow that listens before acting
- Structured document analysis with red flag detection
- Action menu for sealing, anchoring, investigation
- Every response ends with a listening prompt

### üîç Client-Side Forensics
- SHA-512 hashing (Web Crypto API)
- PDF text extraction (PDF.js)
- Optional OCR for image-based PDFs (Tesseract.js)
- Sealed PDF generation with watermarks and QR codes

### ü§ñ Constitutional Personality
- Direct, conversational, cheeky (never cruel)
- Blunt honesty about contradictions
- Plain language first, technical details on request
- Based on `ai-personality.json` from verum-omnis-monorepo

## Usage

### Basic Conversation Flow

1. **Upload a document** (optional)
   - Click üìé button
   - Select PDF, DOC, TXT, or image
   - SHA-512 hash is computed client-side

2. **Provide context**
   - Tell the AI what's concerning you
   - E.g., "This invoice looks fake"

3. **Receive analysis**
   - AI echoes back your concern
   - Provides structured document analysis
   - Flags any red flags or anomalies

4. **Choose next action**
   - Click action buttons or type freely
   - Options: Investigate, Seal, Anchor, Compare, Timeline

5. **Continue conversation**
   - AI always ends with a listening prompt
   - You guide the investigation

### Example Conversation

```
AI: üëã Hey.
    You can upload a file here üìé or just tell me what's bugging you.

[User uploads invoice.pdf]

AI: üìÑ Got your file: invoice.pdf ‚Ä¢ 45,231 bytes.
    Before I do anything ‚Äî tell me in your own words what's going on.
    I'm listening.

User: This invoice looks suspicious. The signature is missing and the 
      dates don't add up.

AI: Okay ‚Äî you're saying:
    > "This invoice looks suspicious. The signature is missing and the 
       dates don't add up."
    
    Here's what I see in the document itself...
    
    üìù First look:
    - Type: Invoice
    - SHA-512 (first 16): A3F2D8E9C1B4A6F7
    - File format: PDF
    - Size: 45,231 bytes
    - Key details: Invoice #12345, dated Jan 15, 2025, for $5,000
    - Red flags: ‚ö†Ô∏è No signature present, inconsistent date formatting
    
    What do you want me to do next?
    
    [üîç Investigate deeper] [üìú Seal] [üîó Anchor] [‚öñÔ∏è Compare] 
    [üß© Timeline] [üí¨ Keep explaining]
    
    Want me to keep digging, or move to something else?
```
