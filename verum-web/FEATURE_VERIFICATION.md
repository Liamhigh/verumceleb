1. **Prepare test file:** Use any PDF with selectable text (e.g., a downloaded article)
2. **Upload:** Click file input and select the PDF
3. **Process:** Click "Process PDF" button
4. **Observe:**
   - Progress messages should show:
     - "📄 Reading file..."
     - "🔐 Computing SHA-512 hash..."
     - "📖 Extracting text from PDF pages..."
     - "Extracted page 1/X"
     - "✅ Document read complete!"
   - Green success banner should appear with:
     - "✅ Document Reading Complete!"
     - "📄 X pages extracted • 🔐 SHA-512 computed • 📖 Text-based PDF"
5. **Verify outputs:**
   - SHA-512 hash displayed (128 hex chars)
   - Page count correct

### Test 3: QR Code Verification
**Purpose:** Verify QR code contains correct hash

1. **Process any PDF** following Test 1 or Test 2
2. **Locate QR preview:** Scroll to "📱 QR Code Preview" section
3. **Scan QR code:**
   - Use phone camera or QR scanner app
   - Scanned content should match the displayed SHA-512 hash exactly
4. **Generate sealed PDF:**
   - Click "🔒 Make sealed cover PDF (with QR)"
   - Download the sealed PDF
   - Open in PDF viewer
   - Verify QR code is embedded on the page
   - Scan embedded QR code and verify it matches the hash

### Test 4: Export Options
**Purpose:** Verify all download options work

After processing a PDF:
1. **SHA512SUMS.txt:**
   - Click "📄 Download SHA512SUMS.txt"
   - Open file and verify format: `{hash} *{filename}`
2. **Forensic Report JSON:**
   - Click "📊 Download report.json"
   - Open and verify structure:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "1.0",
       "generated_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "filename": "...",
       "size_bytes": number,
       "mime": "application/pdf",
       "sha512_hex": "...",
       "page_count": number,
       "ocr_applied": boolean,
       "preview_sample": "..."
     }
     ```
3. **Sealed PDF:**
   - Already tested in Test 3
   - Verify button animates with pulse when ready

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: OCR checkbox not visible
**Solution:** Checkbox is there! Look for "OCR image pages" with green checkmark when enabled.

### Issue: QR code not showing
**Solution:** 
- QR code only appears AFTER processing a PDF
- Scroll down to the hash section
- Look for "📱 QR Code Preview (SHA-512 Hash)" heading
- If still not visible, check browser console for errors

### Issue: "OCR page 1/0" or no OCR processing
**Solution:**
- This means the PDF has selectable text (no OCR needed)
- OCR only runs on "empty" pages (< 8 characters)
- Try a scanned PDF or image-based PDF instead

### Issue: Build fails with font errors
**Solution:** 
- Fixed in `layout.tsx` by removing Google Fonts
- Now uses system fonts only
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` again

### Issue: Sealed PDF has no QR code
**Solution:**
- QR code is embedded but may be small
- Look at bottom half of the seal page
- Should be 140x140px below the timestamp
- If missing, check browser console for import errors

## 🧪 Automated Testing (Future)

Currently, verification is manual. Potential automated tests:

```javascript
// Example test structure (not yet implemented)
describe('PDF Processing', () => {
  it('should extract text from PDF', async () => {
    const result = await extractPdfTextAll(mockPdfBuffer);
    expect(result.text).toContain('expected text');
    expect(result.pages).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });

  it('should generate SHA-512 hash', async () => {
    const hash = await sha512Hex(mockBuffer);
    expect(hash).toHaveLength(128);
    expect(hash).toMatch(/^[A-F0-9]+$/);
  });

  it('should create QR code', async () => {
    const qr = await QRCode.toDataURL('test');
    expect(qr).toMatch(/^data:image\/png/);
  });
});
```

## 🎓 Technical Deep Dive

### How Document Reading Works

1. **File Upload:** User selects PDF via file input
2. **ArrayBuffer:** File converted to ArrayBuffer for processing
3. **PDF.js:** Loads PDF document from buffer
4. **Text Extraction:** For each page:
   - Get page object
   - Extract text content
   - Concatenate text strings
5. **OCR Decision:** If page has < 8 characters:
   - Render page to canvas at 2x scale
   - Pass canvas to Tesseract
   - Extract text via OCR
   - Replace empty page text with OCR result

### How QR Codes Are Generated

1. **Hash Input:** SHA-512 hash (128 hex chars) used as data
2. **QRCode.toDataURL():** Generates PNG data URL
   - Error correction: Medium (M)
   - Size: 200px for preview, 140px for PDF
   - Margin: 1 module
3. **Display:** Data URL set as img src for preview
4. **PDF Embedding:** 
   - PDF-lib embeds PNG data
   - Drawn at coordinates (50, 500)
   - Size: 140x140px

### Why Client-Side Processing?

- **Privacy:** No document uploaded to server
- **Speed:** No network round-trip
- **Security:** Hash computed locally
- **Offline:** Works without internet (after initial load)
- **Trust:** User can inspect code and verify no exfiltration
