## Features Implemented

### 1. Listener-First Conversation Flow ✅

**Greeting System:**
- Case A (No document): "👋 Hey. You can upload a file here 📎 or just tell me what's bugging you."
- Case B (Document uploaded): "📄 Got your file: {filename} • {size} bytes. Before I do anything — tell me in your own words what's going on."

**Context Capture:**
- AI waits for user to explain before analyzing
- Tracks whether context has been provided
- Adjusts behavior based on conversation state

**Echo-Back Behavior:**
- AI reflects user's concerns: "Okay — you're saying: '{user words}'"
- Confirms understanding before proceeding
- Makes user feel heard and validated

### 2. Document Analysis with Red Flags ✅

**Structured Format:**
```
📝 First look:
- Type: [document type]
- SHA-512 (first 16): [hash]
- File format: [PDF/DOC/TXT/Image]
- Size: [bytes]
- Key details: [summary]
- Red flags: [anomalies or "None detected"]
```

**Red Flag Detection:**
- Missing signatures
- Inconsistent dates
- Metadata anomalies
- Formatting irregularities
- Contradictory information

### 3. Action Menu Buttons ✅

**Six Quick Actions:**
1. 🔍 Investigate deeper
2. 📜 Seal (watermark + hash)
3. 🔗 Anchor to blockchain
4. ⚖️ Compare documents
5. 🧩 Build timeline
6. 💬 Keep explaining

**Interaction:**
- Appear after user provides context
- Pre-fill input field with relevant prompt
- Guide conversation naturally
- Maintain user control

### 4. Constitutional Personality ✅

**Tone from ai-personality.json:**
- Direct and conversational
- Cheeky but never cruel
- Blunt honesty about issues
- Plain language first
- Technical details on request

**Behavioral Rules:**
- Never auto-seal or auto-anchor
- Always capture context first
- Echo back concerns
- Offer choices, don't assume
- Close with listening prompt

### 5. Closing Prompts ✅

**Every Response Ends With:**
- "Want me to keep digging, or move to something else?"
- "What's next? Should I look deeper into this?"
- "Shall I compare this with another document?"
- "Do you want me to seal this now, or keep investigating?"

**Purpose:**
- Empowers user to guide conversation
- Prevents AI from assuming next steps
- Maintains human-in-control principle
- Continues listening relationship

### 6. File Upload & Hashing ✅

**Features:**
- 📎 Upload button in chat
- Client-side SHA-512 hashing
- Accepts PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, images
- No server-side file storage
- Privacy-first design

**Display:**
- File name and size in greeting
- Hash prefix (first 16 chars) in message bubble
- Full hash available for forensics

### Usage Example

```
User: [Visits site]

AI: 👋 Hey.
    You can upload a file here 📎 or just tell me what's bugging you.
    (Eg. "The bank ignored my affidavit.")

User: [Uploads invoice.pdf]

AI: 📄 Got your file: invoice.pdf • 45,231 bytes.
    Before I do anything — tell me in your own words what's going on.
    (Eg. "This invoice looks fake" / "This contract was changed without my consent.")
    I'm listening.

User: This invoice looks suspicious. The signature is missing and the dates don't add up.

AI: Okay — you're saying:
    > "This invoice looks suspicious. The signature is missing and the dates don't add up."
    
    Here's what I see in the document itself...
    
    📝 First look:
    - Type: Invoice
    - SHA-512 (first 16): A3F2D8E9C1B4A6F7
    - File format: PDF
    - Size: 45,231 bytes
    - Key details: Invoice #12345, dated Jan 15, 2025, for $5,000 professional services
    - Red flags: ⚠️ No signature present, inconsistent date formatting between header and footer
    
    What do you want me to do next?
    
    The buttons below show your options, or just tell me:
    - Dig deeper for contradictions and red flags
    - Seal this for evidence (watermark + hash)
    - Anchor to blockchain (permanent proof)
    - Compare with another document
    - Build a timeline
    - Or keep talking through it
    
    [🔍 Investigate deeper] [📜 Seal] [🔗 Anchor] [⚖️ Compare] [🧩 Timeline] [💬 Keep explaining]
    
    Want me to keep digging, or move to something else?

User: [Clicks "Seal" button]

AI: [Generates sealed PDF with watermark and QR code]
    ✅ Done.
    I sealed the file with watermark + hash.
    - SHA-512: A3F2D8E9C1B4A6F7...
    - QR code + patent tick added
    - Tamper-proof PDF ready
    
    ⬇️ [Download Sealed PDF]
    
    Do you want me to anchor this to blockchain for permanent proof, or are we good here?
```

## Impact
