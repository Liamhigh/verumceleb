## Key Features Documented

### Core Functionality
1. **SHA-512 Hash Anchoring** - Cryptographic document proof
2. **PDF Sealing** - Generate sealed PDFs with hashes, QR codes, watermarks
3. **Document Verification** - Hash-based authenticity checking
4. **Receipt System** - Persistent storage via Firestore

### Technical Architecture
1. **Stateless Design** - No PII storage, privacy by design
2. **Immutable Governance** - Constitutional rules enforced via SHA-512
3. **Cross-Platform** - Web + iOS + Android via Capacitor
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment

### Security Model
1. **Cryptographic Verification** - Cold start verification of all rules
